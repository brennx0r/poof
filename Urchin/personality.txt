I hide scraps of food and trinkets away in my pockets.
I ask a lot of questions.
I like to squeeze into small places where no one else can get to me.
I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own wrapped in a bundle in my arms.
I eat like a pig and have bad manners.
I think anyone who’s nice to me is hiding evil intent.
I don’t like to bathe.
I bluntly say what other people are hinting at or hiding.
