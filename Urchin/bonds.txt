My town or city is my home, and I’ll fight to defend it.
I sponsor an orphanage to keep others from enduring what I was forced to endure.
I owe my survival to another urchin who taught me to live on the streets.
I owe a debt I can never repay to the person who took pity on me.
I escaped my life of poverty by robbing an important person, and I’m wanted for it.
No one else should have to endure the hardships I’ve been through.
