If I'm outnumbered, I will run away from a fight.
Gold seems like a lot of money to me, and I’ll do just about anything for more of it.
I will never fully trust anyone other than myself.
I’d rather kill someone in their sleep then fight fair.
It’s not stealing if I need it more than someone else.
People who can't take care of themselves get what they deserve.
