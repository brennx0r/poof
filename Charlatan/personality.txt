I fall in and out of love easily, and am always pursuing someone.
I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate.
Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want.
I’m a born gambler who can't resist taking a risk for a potential payoff.
I lie about almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to.
Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.
I keep multiple holy symbols on me and invoke whatever deity might come in useful at any given moment.
I pocket anything I see that might have some value.
