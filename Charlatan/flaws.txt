I can’t resist a pretty face.
I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in..
I’m convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others.
I’m too greedy for my own good. I can’t resist taking a risk if there’s money involved.
I can’t resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.
I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough.
