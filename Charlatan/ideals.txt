Independence. I am a free spirit— no one tells me what to do.
Fairness. I never target people who can’t afford to lose a few coins.
Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it.
Creativity. I never run the same con twice.
Friendship. Material goods come and go. Bonds of friendship last forever.
Aspiration. I’m determined to make something of myself.
