I follow orders, even if I think they’re wrong.
I’ll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.
Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation.
Once I start drinking, it’s hard for me to stop.
I can’t help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.
My pride will probably lead to my destruction.
