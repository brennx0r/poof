My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.
I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.
I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale.
I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.
To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.
I never pass up a friendly wager.
My language is as foul as an otyugh nest.
I like a job well done, especially if I can convince someone else to do it.
