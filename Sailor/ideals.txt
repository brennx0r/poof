Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew.
Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in therewards. 
Freedom. The sea is freedom— the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. 
Mastery. I’m a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. 
People. I’m committed to my crewmates, not to ideals.
Aspiration. Someday I’ll own my own ship and chart my own destiny.
