Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others.
Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority.
Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
Might. In life as in war, the stronger force wins.
Live and Let Live. Ideals arenâ€™t worth killing over or going to war for.
Nation. My city, nation, or people are all that matter.
