I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
There’s no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
I remember every insult I’ve received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who’s ever wronged me.
I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
Don’t expect me to save those who can’t savethemselves. It is nature’s way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.
