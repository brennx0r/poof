My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love.
Someone stole my precious instrument, and someday I’ll get it back.
I want to be famous, whatever it takes.
I idolize a hero of the old tales and measure my deeds against that person’s.
I will do anything to prove myself superior to my hated rival.
I would do anything for the other members of my old troupe.
