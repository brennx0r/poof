Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than it was. 
Tradition. The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who we are.
Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action.
Greed. I’m only in it for the money and fame.
People. I like seeing the smiles on people’s faces when I perform. That’s all that matters.
Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are.
