I know a story relevant to almost every situation.
Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip.
I’m a hopeless romantic, always searching for that “special someone.”
Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension.
I love a good insult, even one directed at me.
I get bitter if I’m not the center of attention.
I’ll settle for nothing less than perfection.
I change my mood or my mind as quickly as I change key in a song.
