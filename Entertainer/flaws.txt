I’ll do anything to win fame and renown.
I’m a sucker for a pretty face.
A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around.
I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat.
I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble.
Despite my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends.
