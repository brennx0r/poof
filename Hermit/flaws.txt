Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much.
I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell.
I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy.
I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships and harmony.
I’d risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.
I like keeping secrets and won’t share them with anyone.
