I’ve been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.
I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.
The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom.
I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.
I’m oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.
I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan.
I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.
I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas.
