I always have a plan for when things go wrong.
I am always calm, no matter what the situation is. I never raise my voice or let my emotions get the best of me.
The 1st thing I do when in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable - or where such things can be hidden.
I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
I don't pay attention to the risks of a situation. Never tell me the odds.
The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.
I blow up at the slightest insult.
