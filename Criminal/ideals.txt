Honor. I don’t steal from others in the trade. 
Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. 
Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. 
Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. 
People. I’m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care.
Redemption. There’s a spark of good in everyone.
