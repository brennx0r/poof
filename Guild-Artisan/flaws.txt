I’ll do anything to get my hands on something rare orpriceless.
I’m quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.
No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers.
I’m never satisfied with what I have— I always want more.
I would kill to acquire a noble title.
I’m horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork. Everywhere I go, I’m surrounded by rivals.
